# CS-3113Project0

The code reads in a file of characters in the form of bytes. In this program and if else condition is implemented to determine how many bytes to read in at a time based on UTF-8 rules in order to store these bytes as a single character in an array of structs. A struct counter is used to keep count of the occurence of each character.
